# Backend Hello
This API allows to interface the database and handles business functions

## Installation
Different ways can be used to spin up a backend Hello API.

### Create the DB
First of, you need to create a postgreSQL DB if it's not already done.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è If your database is already created and running, you can skip this step and directly go to [Run the image](#run-the-image).

Access this [repository](https://github.com/ApplETS/Hello-Database-Setup) to get started!

### Installation introduction

There is two ways you can install the API:
- Using a docker image:  [Docker Installation](#-docker-installation)
  - This method doesn't allows you to modify easily the existing code and is more suited for a local server when there is only front-end development to be done.
- Using the classic approach with Visual Studio: [Local Installation](#-local-installation)

### üê≥ Docker Installation
Start by pulling the image from docker hub
```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/applets/backend-hello:<VERSION>
```
multiple versions are available, you can check them [here](https://github.com/ApplETS/Backend-Hello/pkgs/container/backend-hello/versions)

The default one is `latest` but for cutting edge updates you can use `main` branch name.

#### Running the docker image
You'll need to setup the environment variables in the `.env` file

Simply copy and paste the `.env.template` file, rename it to `.env` and fill it with the correct value.

Then, run the image on your local machine
```bash
docker run --env-file .env --restart always -d -p 8080:8080 -v <PATH_TO_VOLUME_FOLDER>:/app/volume:rw --name ps-api ghcr.io/applets/backend-hello:<VERSION>
```

You can navigate to `http://localhost:8080/swagger` to check if the API is running correctly!

### üë∑ Local Installation
You will need a couple of things to get started developing and maintaining Hello-Backend.
- Docker (suppose to be already installed at this point)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- Visual Studio 2022 or above version.
  - Make sure to check the ASP.NET and web development component

- .NET8 (which is supposed to come package with VS2022, but in case it's not.)

#### Setup
1- Open Bash, navigate to somewhere you like:
```bash
cd path/to/repo
```
2- Clone the repo using an [ssh key](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent) or without:
```bash
# With an SSH Key
git clone git@github.com:ApplETS/Backend-Hello.git
# Without an ssh key
git clone https://github.com/ApplETS/Backend-Hello.git
```
3- Open the .sln in Visual Studio 2022
4- You'll now need to create your `.env` file from the `.env.template`. You can ask help to fill the empty values from a project maintainer.


#### Running the app using Visual Studio
To run the app make sure to check Docker to run it using docker:

Then click on ![image](https://github.com/ApplETS/Backend-Hello/assets/25663435/de874f36-47e0-4e9f-8c8f-9e7e21a67d6c) to run the API.

You can navigate to http://localhost:8080 where you're app is running.
